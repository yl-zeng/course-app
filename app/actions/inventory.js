Every day, we effectively transmit highly personal and sensitive data about ourselves to strangers. If all goes well, only the intended recipients ever see our information. If not, the results can be disastrous. Thus the criticality of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS provides guidance to organizations that collect, process, transmit, or store cardholder data. In this course, you will learn about PCI DSS: the data it is intended to secure, its requirements, how to incorporate those requirements into code, and how to avoid common mistakes that can make your software vulnerable to attack.",

Although cryptography does not eliminate security issues, it does make them more manageable by reducing the task of protecting a large amount of data to a matter of protecting a relatively small key. This course discusses the use of cryptographic algorithms and techniques as they are typically applied within the practice of information security.",
